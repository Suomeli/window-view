# window-view
The aim of this project was to create a simulated view from a building window in Helsinki, which would simulate how the view would in reality look like. The simulated view is created for given street address, floor level and direction.

The simulated view does not give the exact location of a window in apartment but more of a generic view from the building.A simulated view from a building has many applications. It can be used to see the surrounding environment before buying or renting apartments. This type of simulation could also see usage when constructing new buildings. One could see what kind of scenery would be visible from the building or see how the structure would affect the view of nearby buildings. The view from the window could alsobe used in different analysis. It is possible to calculate the farthest distance from the view or one could calculate the amount of sunlight that reaches the window at different times of day or season. These are just couple applications where this kind ofsimulation would be beneficial.

This project uses Unity 3D game engine as environment, where the data is visualized,and effects of activated scripts happen. The scripts are written in C# programming language and the version control of the project was done via GitHub. GitHub desktop was utilized to communicate with GitHub from a desktop application.

This project uses a 3D city model, address registry of Greater Helsinki region and an elevation model as data. All of the data are public,and the provider is city of Helsinki.

This project needs Unity installed. For instructions and technical description of this project check out the documentation file.
